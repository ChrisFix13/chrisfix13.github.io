Contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as \"late flight\" or \"rude service\"). The dataset can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)\n","\n","You should build an NLP pipeline to find all tweets that are related to `bad catering service`. In particular, you should do the following:\n","- Load the `tweets` dataset using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). You can find this dataset in the datasets folder.\n","- Train a text representation model, such as the [bag of n-gram vectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) or [TF-IDF vectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html), on the content of the tweets.\n","- Apply the trained text representation model to vectorize the query (i.e., `bad catering service`) and all documents (i.e., tweets).\n","- Calculate the similarity of each vectorized tweet to the vectorized query using a similarity measure, such as [cosine similarity](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html).\n","- Rank the tweets based on the similarity of their vectors to the query vector.\n","- Check the documentation to identify the most important hyperparameters, attributes, and methods of the model. Use them in practice.\n","\n","## Advanced Vectorization\n","You should build an NLP pipeline using a pretrained word embedding model. In particular, you should do the following:\n","- Find a pretrained word embedding model, such as [Google's word2vec model](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).\n","- Load the pretrained word embedding model using a library, such as [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html).\n","- Examine the word vectors. For example, what is the most similar word to `Berlin`?\n","- Visualize a sample of word vectors using necessary libraries, such as [Sklearn's t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/)."],"id":"W8By1SWShC5w"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ac299267","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"},"id":"ac299267"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')\n","df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":929},"id":"7km97yrqiAD1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715076627960,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":464,"user":{"displayName":"Christian Jensen","userId":"02425213888647688423"}},"outputId":"d6a29202-d0df-433e-962e-0628eafb68a3"},"id":"7km97yrqiAD1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                 tweet_id airline_sentiment  airline_sentiment_confidence  \\\n","0      570306133677760513           neutral                        1.0000   \n","1      570301130888122368          positive                        0.3486   \n","2      570301083672813571           neutral                        0.6837   \n","3      570301031407624196          negative                        1.0000   \n","4      570300817074462722          negative                        1.0000   \n","...                   ...               ...                           ...   \n","14635  569587686496825344          positive                        0.3487   \n","14636  569587371693355008          negative                        1.0000   \n","14637  569587242672398336           neutral                        1.0000   \n","14638  569587188687634433          negative                        1.0000   \n","14639  569587140490866689           neutral                        0.6771   \n","\n","               negativereason  negativereason_confidence         airline  \\\n","0                         NaN                        NaN  Virgin America   \n","1                         NaN                     0.0000  Virgin America   \n","2                         NaN                        NaN  Virgin America   \n","3                  Bad Flight                     0.7033  Virgin America   \n","4                  Can't Tell                     1.0000  Virgin America   \n","...                       ...                        ...             ...   \n","14635                     NaN                     0.0000        American   \n","14636  Customer Service Issue                     1.0000        American   \n","14637                     NaN                        NaN        American   \n","14638  Customer Service Issue                     0.6659        American   \n","14639                     NaN                     0.0000        American   \n","\n","      airline_sentiment_gold             name negativereason_gold  \\\n","0                        NaN          cairdin                 NaN   \n","1                        NaN         jnardino                 NaN   \n","2                        NaN       yvonnalynn                 NaN   \n","3                        NaN         jnardino                 NaN   \n","4                        NaN         jnardino                 NaN   \n","...                      ...              ...                 ...   \n","14635                    NaN  KristenReenders                 NaN   \n","14636                    NaN         itsropes                 NaN   \n","14637                    NaN         sanyabun                 NaN   \n","14638                    NaN       SraJackson                 NaN   \n","14639                    NaN        daviddtwu                 NaN   \n","\n","       retweet_count                                               text  \\\n","0                  0                @VirginAmerica What @dhepburn said.   \n","1                  0  @VirginAmerica plus you've added commercials t...   \n","2                  0  @VirginAmerica I didn't today...
